  Ungineering is an idea conceived by two students of NIT Durgapur, who felt there was something missing in the whole duration of their undergraduate lives.

It aims to provide a learning platform to the students where they will become capable of building and deploying software products right from scratch.

To know how it works, read <a href="http://www.ungineering.com/#faq">FAQ</a>.

<strong>How it all happened?</strong>
<br />
It is a badly kept secret that no one talks sense during daytime in an engineering college.

Hence, one night under the influence of an alkaline substance and a full moons light, Anuj Kalbalia and Avishek Basu Mallick had an epiphany: that they have learned a lot in college and none of it was in the classroom. <span class="nonsense">(Wish they had attended more lectures to give the classrooms a fair chance)</span>

They did not want to be called engineers anymore just by the virtue of having a degree. <span class="nonsense">(A profound realization that only getting a job or an admission in the top B-School can provide)</span>

They knew that if they opened their textbooks again, it would still be Hebrew, Greek and Latin. <span class="nonsense">(Assumption here is that they have opened those books before)</span>

However, thanks to their involvement in the campus activities <span class="nonsense">(where all the name, fame and sometimes a dame resides)</span>, they had a belief that they could take on any full time project and execute it, both as an idea and as a technique.
